# SFML Poker w/ Winning Intervals
## Backstory/About
As cs, math and stats student, I wanted to work on something that really combines all of these together.
I really like games, but I hate losing (especially money). I got into poker because of some of my friends,
but at the beginning it was difficult to grasp whether a bet was good or bad and I constantly had to look at the card 
tier list and overthink about whether to raise, call or fold. In nearly all cases, it's very
difficult to determine if you have 100% won the round or not, but getting some sort of indication of the likelihood
of winning will definitely help beginner players think about how much they should bet. After taking a number of
statistics courses at my university, I think incorporating something like a confidence interval would provide a 
player insight on their current hand. Of course if you are playing with little experience, you can think about
the various probabilities in the moment and get a general sense, but getting a precise likelihood would be more
useful for novice players, and also it's not something that the majority of people can do in their head. I also 
wanted to brush up on some programming skills like properly documenting things, writing clean and modular code, and
getting familiar with c++ again.

## Development Roadmap
#### 1. Finish Initial Implementation
        - Add Game Class
        - Implement Game Logic (Apply Poker Rules i.e. min bet etc.)
#### 2. Add Winning Probabilities
#### 3. Add SFML Graphical Interface
